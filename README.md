**\#\# Overview**  
For Lab 1, we were asked to evaluate and test a simple function that determines if a calendar year, represented as an integer, is a leap year. The function should return a boolean of “True” if it is a leap year and “False” if it is not. 

We needed to evaluate this program based on the four internal logic tests it uses to determine if a year is, in fact, a leap year. This splits our equivalence partitions into four distinct groups, and we should test a value from each partition to ensure the function is working as required.   
For this assignment, we will assume the function is called “leapYear”.

Additionally, we had to document what our test inputs and expected outputs are, which will be included in a broad overview table. Finally we needed to provide a “Devil’s advocate” account of things that our tests could potentially miss
